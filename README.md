# build-stockly-MarketingUI-Isaac

My primary role as a User Interface Developer was to build a multi-page marketing website.

Given that we had no UX Designer, I designed initial moodboards for the team and got agreement on the preferred style off the app. From this point, I designed mock-ups using Figma to guide the development of the website. 

The marketing website has been built using vanilla html, javascript and css. It has been completed from a mobile-first perspective, and thus breakpoints align with desktop widths. The main call to action redirects the user to the front-end of the application which is then connected to the backend.
