# build-stockly-MarketingUI-Isaac

Î£tockly helps users make informative decisions as to what actions to make given a stock's price, Twitter sentiment and careful analysis from a machine learning model.

My primary role on the project as a User Interface Developer was to build a multi-page marketing website.

Given that we had no UX Designer, I designed the moodboards for the team and got agreement on the preferred style off the app. From that point, I designed mock-ups using Figma to guide the development of the website while providing the team with assets. 

The marketing website has been built using vanilla html, javascript and css. It has been completed from a mobile-first perspective, consequently having breakpoints that align with desktop widths. The main call to action redirects the user to the front-end of the application which then receives data from the backend.
